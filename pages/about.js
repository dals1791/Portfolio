              I am a full-stack software engineer who exemplifies a can-do
              attitude and willingness to dive into the unknown. My
              6 years of experience as a bio-mechanical engineer (BSME) enables me to uniquely approach
              every challenge with a passion and desire to solve technical
              problems that will improve the life we live today.{" "}

              Besides engineering, I am based out of Austin Texas, am an avid
              skier, love the outdoors, the local brews, and always have a
              craving for tacos.
